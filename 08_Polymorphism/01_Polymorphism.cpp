    // Polymorphism
    /*
    Poly-morphism obvioussly means having multiple forms. We have already seen the glimpse of this in concepts like operator overloading.

    So polymorphism is of two types. 
    1) Compile time polymorphism
    In this type of polymorphism, the function or the operator to be used is already decided by the compiler. There are two types-
        - Operator overloading
        - Function overloading


    2) Run-time polymorphism
    In this type of polymorphism, the function or form of function to be used is decided in run time, that is, dynamically.
    There is one sub-type-
        - Virtual functions
